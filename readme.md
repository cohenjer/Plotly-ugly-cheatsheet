# Plotly simple editing examples

For some reason I cannot find simple but detailed lists of usual plotly editing commands. Plotly docs is hard to navigate, and the underscore/dictionary magic syntax is a little confusing to me.

So here are the commands I use often for data science.

Feel free to add more examples, as long as they are simple ugly plots with lots of useless editings so that functionalities are explicit.
